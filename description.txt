This mod requires TerraGuardians Mod installed to work.

This is Gaomon Companion Mod. This mod has been made to showcase how you can 
make a custom companion for TerraGuardians Mod, and make it show up in-game.

It might actually be outdated or with missing hooks you can use for companion base 
infos, so I recommend checking the TerraGuardians Mod companion scripts if you want 
to further expand your companions.

TerraGuardians Mod can be found on the Steam Workshop too.
